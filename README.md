# 🚦 Project 7: Traffic Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion is a persistent issue caused by the lack of understanding of traffic flow and patterns. Effective traffic data analysis can help city planners design better transportation systems and reduce congestion.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To utilize vehicle count or GPS data to identify:
- Peak traffic hours
- High-density zones
- Anomalies in traffic flow
- Predictive trends using statistical or machine learning models

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The project uses data containing:
- **Timestamps** of vehicle movements
- **Vehicle count per hour** or **GPS coordinates**
- **Location-wise entries** to track spatial congestion

---

## 🛠️ Key Tasks & Methods
- 📈 Plotting **traffic density** over time using time series plots
- 🕒 Identifying **peak traffic periods** by hour/day
- ⚠️ Detecting **anomalies or sudden spikes** in traffic data
- 🔮 (Optional) **Predicting peak hours** using regression (Linear Regression/Time Series)

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Line Charts:** For hourly/daily traffic trends
- **Bar Graphs:** For location-wise vehicle counts
- **Heatmaps:** To show congestion hotspots (if GPS data is used)
- **Regression Plots:** To show traffic volume predictions

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome
- Analytical **reports and visual graphs** highlighting:
  - Peak congestion times
  - Recommendations for route changes or optimizations
  - Predictive insights for **smart city planning**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn** (for optional regression modeling)
